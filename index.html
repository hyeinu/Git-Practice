Git Stuff
  Turn this file directory into a repro (or adding a repro in the file directory)
    1. git init - makes an empty .git working directory
      1.1 git status - gives you the status of the directory
      1.2 shows you all the untracked files
      1.3 branch master - default branch
    2. git add . - stages the files (add all the files in the directory can also use an *)
    3. git commit -m "create index.html" - will commit the change but needs a description (be descriptive)
      3.1 without a message it will take you to the VIM
      3.2 modal text editor (has different modes)
      3.3 need to hit 'i' to go into insert mode (hit esc to go back to main mode)
      3.4 type the message after you go into insert mode
      3.5 go back to normal mode
      3.6 :wq (write/save and quit)
    4. git status to show the changes
    5. add/commit (repeat steps 2+3) any changes that you made to the files
  Pushing the files to the github repro
    1. git remote add origin https://github.com/hyeinu/Git-Practice.git
      1.1 the name of the remote usually origin
      1.2 you don't necessarily need the .git
      1.3 git remote -v will list all the remote(url)
    2. git push origin master
      2.1 pushes all the commits into the "web" or url
      2.2 origin is the name of the remote location
      2.3 master is which branch
      2.4 git push -u origin master (the -u sets the origin master as the default)
    3. if making any other commits from section one repeat step 2 to push the changes online.
